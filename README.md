## Prerequisites
- [Java SE Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm)

## Installation & environment setup🛠️
- Download and open the `snake.asm` file in MARS
- Open the `Bitmap Display`, press `Connect to MIPS` and set:
  - Unit Width in Pixels to 8
  - Unit Height in Pixels to 8
- Open the `Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator` and press `Connect to MIPS`
- Run the program to start playing! Use `WASD` to move. Note that in the initial position, the snake is heading right so you can't move left.

## Remarks❗
- This code was inspired by [shahmaty](https://github.com/shahmaty)'s [assemblySnake](https://github.com/shahmaty/assemblySnake) program.
- I made this program in only 8 hours, so feel free to improve upon it!
- Apparently there is a bug that makes MARS freeze randomly when you press a moving key.
