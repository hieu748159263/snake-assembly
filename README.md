## Installation & environment setup🛠️
- Download and open the `snake.asm` file in MARS
- Open the `Bitmap Display`, press `Connect to MIPS` and set:

## Remarks📌
- This code was inspired by [shahmaty](https://github.com/shahmaty)'s [assemblySnake](https://github.com/shahmaty/assemblySnake) program.
- I made this program in only 8 hours, so feel free to improve upon it!
- Apparently there is a bug that makes MARS freeze randomly when you press a moving key.
- Check out the pseudo code, notes and comments in the `snake.asm` file for information about how this program works.
