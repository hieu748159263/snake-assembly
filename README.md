- [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm)

# Installation & environment setup🛠️
- Download and open the `snake.asm` file in MARS
- Open the `Bitmap Display`, press `Connect to MIPS` and set:
  - Unit Width in Pixels to 8
  - Unit Height in Pixels to 8
- Open the `Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator` and press `Connect to MIPS`

# Remarks and thoughts📌
- Apparently there is a bug that makes MARS freeze randomly when you press a moving key.
- Check out the pseudo code, notes and comments in the `snake.asm` file for information about how this program works.
- Although this is just a work for the finals of one of my subjects at school, I was really having fun doing it. I was really passionate about making this work, and I'm really excited to see the program working after hours of coding and debugging :D 
- It takes me 8 hours to finish this program, all in one sitting (including the time to learn about the game's mechanic).
